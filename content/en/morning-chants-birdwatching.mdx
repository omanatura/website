### About this tour

As dawn breaks over La Fortuna, the forest awakens with a symphony of melodies, inviting you to immerse yourself in the vibrant world of tropical birds. This early morning experience offers a front-row seat to nature’s daily chorus, as colorful toucans, parrots, and tanagers flit through the canopy, their calls echoing through the misty air. Keep an eye out for the iridescent flash of hummingbirds darting among the flowers, or the majestic sight of raptors soaring above the treetops.

Guided by passionate experts, you’ll learn about the unique behaviors, habitats, and conservation efforts that protect these feathered wonders. Each step along the trail reveals new surprises, from the intricate nests of oropendulas to the elusive beauty of trogons and motmots. This tour is designed for all ages, offering a peaceful yet exhilarating way to connect with nature and witness the delicate balance of life in the rainforest.

As the sun rises higher, painting the sky in warm hues, you’ll leave with a deeper appreciation for Costa Rica’s avian treasures and the vital role they play in the ecosystem. This is more than just a birdwatching excursion—it’s an opportunity to slow down, listen closely, and let the magic of the forest inspire a lasting connection to the natural world.
